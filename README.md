# Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Vehicle Drone Routing Problem with Backhauls

Currently, there are two main implementation strategies:
- **multi-agent**
- **hierarchical decision**

## implementation



## data

- Adapted Solomon Instances: Many researchers solving the VRPBTW use adaptations of the well-known Solomon VRPTW instances (R1, R2, C1, C2, RC1, RC2 instance sets). These adaptations involve assigning a portion of the customers as "backhaul" customers and defining their pickup demands.
- Thangiah Datasets: Sam Thangiah developed specific datasets for VRP with backhauls which are available in repositories like the OR-Library or the VRP-REP website (via older links).
- VRP-REP Repository: This is a major public repository for VRP benchmarks. While the specific Queiroga et al. (2019) datasets mentioned previously do not have time windows, the VRP-REP website is generally the central place to find various VRP variants and should have links or the actual files for VRPBTW instances, often categorized by the paper that introduced the adaptation.
- Recent Research Datasets: More recent research papers introduce new datasets, often with more complex or realistic constraints (e.g., electric vehicles, dynamic conditions, or simultaneous pickup/delivery). A 2025 dataset for the Electric VRPBTW under uncertainty is one such example and is available via the National Center for Sustainable Transportation.
